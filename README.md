## 

It would be appreciated if a reference to the following work, for which this package was originally build, is included whenever this code is used for a publication: (Autors for the moment, a paper is in progres)

KrakenOS (Kraken - Optical Simulator) is a python library based in Numpy, Matplotlib, PyVTK and PyVista libraries, it provides a three-dimensional optical systems visualization and ray tracing. This tool has been programed on the object-oriented paradigm. KrakenOS focuses on performing sequential and non-sequential exact ray tracing, it permits to define all the parameters of the optical elements or even the mathematical function to describe their shape, it also allows adding optical properties to 3D solid elements in STL format and use glass catalogs. The library permit to control and modifying the position of the surfaces in a three-dimensional space, this allows generating off-axis systems. It also has several tools such as the calculation of wavefront aberrations in terms of Zernike polynomials, Seidel sums, Entrance and exit pupil calculation and paraxial optics.

## install KrakenOS
```python
pip install KrakenOS
```

## Prerequisites
The library has been tested with the following packages and versions, these are also installed with the previous instruction.
• Python '3.7.4'          
• numpy '1.18.5'          
• scipy '1.7.1'          
• pyvista '0.25.3'          
• pyvtk '0.5.18'  
• matplotlib '3.4.3'  
• vtk '8.2'          
• csv '1.0'

to install prerequisites

```python
pip install pyvista
pip install PyVTK
pip install vtk
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install csv342
```



• Or clone the repository and place the directory “KrakenOS” in the same path where the code to be executed is located.    

> **⚠ WARNING: If you prefer clone the repositoy instead of using pip install KrakenOS, modify the first line in the file /KrakenOS/SetupClass.py from pip = True to False.**  

### 

```python
pip = False
```

> **⚠ WARNING: The before mentioned modification is not required in last version, the file /KrakenOS/SetupClass.py do not have the option pip = True.**  

## Surfaces and the optical system
The library has been simplified to the point of having only two classes of objects for the definition of a system, these are surf and system.
The surf object contains all the relevant information of every optical interface, in this way, every optical interface is an object of the surf class, all interfaces, from the object plane to the image plane, contain attributes of size, shape, material or orientation.

### A little fun before class ... and objects

```python
"""Examp Doublet Lens Pupil"""

# Loading the library
import KrakenOS as Kos
```

```python
# Creating an object of the surf class for the object plane
P_Obj = Kos.surf()
P_Obj.Thickness = 100
P_Obj.Glass = "AIR"
P_Obj.Diameter = 30.0

# Creating a surface for the first face in BK7 Glass
L1a = Kos.surf()
L1a.Rc = 92.847
L1a.Thickness = 6.0
L1a.Glass = "BK7"
L1a.Diameter = 30.0

# Creating a surface for the second face in F2 Glass
L1b = Kos.surf()
L1b.Rc = -30.716
L1b.Thickness = 3.0
L1b.Glass = "F2"
L1b.Diameter = 30

# Creating a surface for the third interface to air
L1c = Kos.surf()
L1c.Rc = -78.197
L1c.Thickness = 97.376 - 40
L1c.Glass = "AIR"
L1c.Diameter = 30

# Creating a surface to exemplify a pupil
pupila.Rc = 30
pupila.Thickness = 40.
pupila.Glass = "AIR"
pupila.Diameter = 5
pupila.Name = "Pupil"
pupila.DespY = 0.
pupila.Nm_Poss=[-10,10]

# Creating a surface for image plane
P_Ima = Kos.surf()
P_Ima.Rc = 0.0
P_Ima.Thickness = 0.0
P_Ima.Glass = "AIR"
P_Ima.Diameter = 20.0
P_Ima.Name = "P_Ima"
P_Ima.Nm_Poss=[-10,10]
```

Creating a list with all the surfaces and loading the default grass catalogs (See user manual)
```python
A = [P_Obj, L1a, L1b, L1c, pupila, P_Ima]
config_1 = Kos.Setup()
```

```python
# Creating the system with previus information
Doblete = Kos.system(A, config_1)
```

Creating a ray container
```python
Rays = Kos.raykeeper(Doulet)
```

Defining parameters to configure pupil on surface 4 (Again.., see user manual)
```python
W = 0.4
sur = 4
AperVal = 10
AperType = "EPD"
Pup = Kos.PupilCalc(Doublet, sur, W, AperType, AperVal)

# Configuring field and ray array type
Pup.Samp = 3
Pup.Ptype = "fan"
Pup.FieldType = "angle"
Pup.FieldY = 2.0
```

Generating and tracing rays 
```python

# ray origin coordinates and direction cosines
x, y, z, L, M, N = Pup.Pattern2Field()

# Tracing the rays with a loop
for i in range(0, len(x)):
    pSource_0 = [x[i], y[i], z[i]]
    dCos = [L[i], M[i], N[i]]
    Doblete.Trace(pSource_0, dCos, W)
    Rays.push()# Saving rays

# Configuring (-field) and ray array type,.. etc
Pup.FieldY = -Pup.FieldY
x, y, z, L, M, N = Pup.Pattern2Field()
for i in range(0, len(x)):
    pSource_0 = [x[i], y[i], z[i]]
    dCos = [L[i], M[i], N[i]]
    Doblete.Trace(pSource_0, dCos, W)
    Rays.push() # Saving rays
```

3D plotting
```python
Kos.display3d(Doblete, Rays,2)
```

![GitHub Logo](/images/01.png)




Or for 2D plotting
```python
Kos.display2d(Doblete, Rays,0,1)
```
